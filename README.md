# Crime-Citations
This is my inital learning Data project to familarize myself with various python tool and methods.
The project goal is to eventualy combine San Francisco crime data with SF parking citation data to compute a relative risk factor for various parking locations for the average driver.

Currently there is no parking citation data available for SF, but there is for Baltimore so I'm using that as a stand-in.

To familarize myself with handling the Baltimore dataset, I'm just looking at the street cleaning citations in an attempt to predict a particular street's street cleaning schedule which follows a predictable pattern and can be verified. 

The data sets can be found at:
Baltimore Citation Data:
https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Transportation/Parking-Citations/n4ma-fj3m

SF Crime Reports:
https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/SFPD-Incidents-from-1-January-2003/tmnf-yvry

SF and Baltimore Map Data:

The Imposm Geojson file is all you need.

Everything you need to run the scripts here are here:

Processing the baltimore street cleaning data and applying takes about 30mins so it's there.
